# SkillForge - Skill-Sharing Platform

SkillForge is a full-stack web application designed to connect individuals seeking to learn new skills with experts willing to share their knowledge. Users can browse available skills, book sessions with providers, leave reviews, and providers can manage their skill listings and booking requests. The platform also features AI-powered keyword suggestions for skill creation.

## üöÄ Getting Started

Follow these instructions to get a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

*   **Node.js:** (v18.x or later recommended) - Download from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/)
*   **npm:** (Usually comes with Node.js)
*   **Git:** - Download from [git-scm.com](https://git-scm.com/)
*   **PostgreSQL:** Installed locally or access to a PostgreSQL instance.

### Installation & Setup

1.  **Clone the Repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/atharv-pdarshi/skill-forge.git
    cd skill-forge
    ```

2.  **Backend Setup:**
    *   Navigate to the backend directory:
        ```bash
        cd backend
        ```
    *   Install dependencies:
        ```bash
        npm install
        ```
    *   **Database Setup (Local PostgreSQL):**
        *   Ensure PostgreSQL is running.
        *   Connect to `psql` (e.g., `sudo -i -u postgres` then `psql`).
        *   Create a database user:
            ```sql
            CREATE USER your_db_user WITH PASSWORD 'your_db_password';
            ```
        *   Create a database:
            ```sql
            CREATE DATABASE skill_share_db; -- Or your preferred name
            ```
        *   Grant privileges:
            ```sql
            GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON DATABASE skill_share_db TO your_db_user;
            ```
        *   Exit `psql` and the postgres user session.
    *   **Create and Configure `.env` File:**
        *   In the `backend` directory, create a `.env` file.
        *   Add the following environment variables, replacing placeholder values:
            ```env
            DATABASE_URL="postgresql://your_db_user:your_db_password@localhost:5432/skill_share_db?schema=public"
            PORT=4000
            TOKEN_KEY="YOUR_VERY_STRONG_AND_UNIQUE_JWT_SECRET_KEY"
            EMAIL_USER="your_gmail_address@gmail.com"
            EMAIL_PASS="your_gmail_app_password" # For Nodemailer via Gmail
            COHERE_API_KEY="your_cohere_api_key"
            # NODE_ENV=development (optional, defaults to development if not set)
            ```
    *   **Run Database Migrations:**
        ```bash
        npx prisma migrate dev
        ```
        (This will also generate the Prisma Client)
    *   **Start the Backend Server:**
        ```bash
        npm start
        ```
        The backend should be running on `http://localhost:4000`.

3.  **Frontend Setup:**
    *   Open a new terminal.
    *   Navigate to the frontend directory:
        ```bash
        cd frontend 
        # (If you are in skill-forge/backend, use: cd ../frontend)
        ```
    *   Install dependencies:
        ```bash
        npm install
        ```
    *   **Create and Configure `.env.local` File:**
        *   In the `frontend` directory, create a `.env.local` file.
        *   Add the following environment variable:
            ```env
            NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=http://localhost:4000/api 
            ```
            (This points to your locally running backend)
    *   **Start the Frontend Development Server:**
        ```bash
        npm run dev
        ```
        The frontend should be accessible at `http://localhost:3000`.

## ‚òÅÔ∏è Deployment

This application has been successfully deployed using the following services:

*   **Database (PostgreSQL):** Supabase
*   **Backend API (Node.js/Express):** Render
*   **Frontend (Next.js):** Vercel

**General Deployment Steps:**
1.  Set up the Supabase database and run Prisma migrations against it (`npx prisma migrate deploy`).
2.  Deploy the `backend` to Render, ensuring all environment variables (including the Supabase `DATABASE_URL`) are correctly configured.
3.  Deploy the `frontend` to Vercel, ensuring the `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL` environment variable points to the deployed Render backend URL.
4.  Configure CORS on the backend to accept requests from the Vercel frontend domain.
